# CompGeo

Tomasz Golebiowski's Computational Geometry Library
A continuation of this repo: https://bitbucket.org/tgolebiowski/delaunyandvoronoi
which I had accidentally messed up

Implementation of certain Computational Geometery Algorithms, mostly having to do with 2D space partitioning.

Features: 
  Poisson Disc Point Sampling, 
  Delaunay Triangulation 
    -2D search using triangle walks 
    -Flood Fill 
    -Incremental point insertions 
  Voronoi Diagrams
